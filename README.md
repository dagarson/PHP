# PHP
programs written with php to do the following 

1. Create a programming solution that calculates the total square feet of flooring
required to cover a room. Use a Web form with three text boxes: one for the length 
in linear feet, one for the width in linear feet, and the third for the price per square foot of the flooring. 

2.  Write a programming solution that allows the user to enter a number of pennies
into a text box.   Determine how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies from the amount of pennies given.  

3. Create a programming solution that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4.  However, century years, those equally
divisible by 100, must also be equally divisible by 400 in order to be a leap year.
So, 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not, even though 1900 is equally divisible by 4, it is not equally divisible by 400.

4. Write a solution that determines whether 3 numbers, representing lengths,
can form the three sides of a triangle. The combined lengths of any two sides
of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side for the segments to form a triangle.

5.  AIRLINE: Create a Web solution that stores airline survey results in text files. 

Include fields for the date and time of the flight, flight number, and so on.

Also, include radio buttons for the following questions:

 Friendliness of customer staff?
 Space for luggage storage?
 Comfort of seating?
 Cleanliness of aircraft?
 Noise level of aircraft?
Store the results of each individual survey in a separate text file.  

Include a "View Past Survey Results" button on the main page that displays a list of past survey results.

6. Use the function on a page that allows the user to submit possible palindromes.
Your visitor should see each string echoed to the screen followed by a statement specifying whether it's a palindrome.

7.Allow users to guess the word letter-by-letter 
by entering a character in a form. Start by assigning a secret 
word to a variable. After each guess, print the word using asterisks
for each remaining letter, but fill in the correctly guessed letters.

8. Pull the counties database below.
Please uses countiesUser and myPassword when creating the database.
Create a PHP script that will allow the user to view the list of all counties sorted (both ascending or descending) by:
county name
county population
FIPS code
land area

9.Get a list of countries from the WWW from the Web site
http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/populations/ctypopls.htm.
Create a table named countries in a database named countries.
The countries database needs to include the name, population, area by kilometers squared,
population density by kilometers squared, area by miles squared, and population density by miles squared.
Create a countriesUser with a password of myPassword. Create PHP scripts that will allow the user to view
 the list of all countries sorted (both ascending and descending) by:
country name
country population

10.Create a database for a used car dealership that includes a cars table for inventory.
Include the following fields in the inventory table: make, model, year, price and mpg.
Enter at least ten records into the table.  Create a carsUser with a password of myPassword.
Create a PHP script that will allow the user to:
View the list of all cars sorted by make
View the list of all cars sorted by model
View the car with the best MPG
View the car with the worst MPG

11.Create a programming solution using a database that registers users for a professional conference.
Enter at least ten records into the table.  Use a single database table that saves information for each registrant.
Collect a name, address and telephone number.


12.Create a Web solution using a database that stores airline survey results in databases.
Include fields for the date and time of the flight, flight number, and so on.
Enter at least ten records into the table.  Also, include radio buttons for the following question:
Friendliness of customer staff?
Space for luggage storage?
Comfort of seating?
Cleanliness of aircraft?
Noise level of aircraft?
